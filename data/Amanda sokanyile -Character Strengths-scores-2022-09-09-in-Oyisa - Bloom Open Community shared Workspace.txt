You will see them question: and then their answer, this is important because they wrote it out:
Question: What is the motivation behind your entrepreneurial pursuits?
Answer: Coming from a disadvantaged background myself and not having a consistent support system and informed guidance. I am motivated by the fact that I am creating a network of people that can provide the youth with practical or emotional support. These support systems will in turn help the youth improve their overall well being and economic participation.
