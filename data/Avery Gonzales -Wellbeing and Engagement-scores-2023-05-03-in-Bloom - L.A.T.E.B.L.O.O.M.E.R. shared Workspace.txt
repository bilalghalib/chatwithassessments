Question: What is the motivation behind your entrepreneurial pursuits?
Answer: I want to be an entrepreneur to be a part of the next wave of solutions to emergent problems: climate change, hypercapitalism, neoliberalism, migration, artificial intelligence and automation, etc. Specifically, I want to lead a revolution in learning and education, creating alternate pathways and frameworks for generating and sharing knowledge in a global yet increasingly local society.
